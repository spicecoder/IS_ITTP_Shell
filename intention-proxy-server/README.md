# Intention Proxy Server (demo)
This is the Object-proxy demo for Intention Space. It verifies signed Intentions (HMAC demo),
checks contentHash, runs a simple fast classifier and either publishes or quarantines the payload.

Quickstart:
1. In this directory run: `chmod +x run_iptp.sh && ./run_iptp.sh`
2. Server listens on http://localhost:3000
3. Use the client package to send demo intentions.
