Command Overview
================

Navigation Commands:
  cd [PATH]              Standard directory change
  goto PATH              Change directory with auto-save
  goto '*pattern*'       Fuzzy find and navigate

  name [INTENTION]       Name current process with intention
  save                   Save current state
  list                   List all saved processes
  jump PROCESS           Jump to saved process location
  state                  Show current state (IPTP format)

DNS Router Commands:
  dns start              Start DNS router service
  dns stop               Stop DNS router service
  dns status             Show DNS router status
  dns logs [N]           Show last N DNS queries (default 10)
  dns stats              Show DNS statistics
  dns install            Show service installation instructions

Key Technologies
================
• Go 1.21+ (standard library)
• github.com/miekg/dns (DNS protocol library)
• JSON for state persistence
• Cross-platform (macOS/Linux/Windows)
• UDP sockets for DNS
• Filesystem for log storage


IPTP Concepts Implemented
==========================
✓ Intentions          - Natural language process naming
✓ The Field           - External state in /tmp/iptp_state.json
✓ Pulses              - Trivalent truth values (Y/N/U)
✓ Design Nodes        - DNS router as a DN
✓ Shared Knowledge    - DNS logs accessible to all
✓ Semantic Progress   - Intent-driven, not time-driven


Runtime Files (Created at Runtime)
===================================
/tmp/iptp_state.json           Process state persistence
/tmp/iptp_dns_queries.log      DNS query logs (JSON format)


Build Commands
==============
# Build all platforms
./build.sh

# Build for current platform only
go build -o iptp .

# Build for specific platform
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o iptp-mac .


Quick Start Commands
====================
# 1. Build
./build.sh

# 2. Run (DNS needs sudo)
sudo ./iptp

# 3. Start DNS router
[IPTP-1] ~$ dns start

# 4. Monitor queries
[IPTP-1] ~$ dns logs 20


Dependencies Installation
=========================
# Get DNS library
go get github.com/miekg/dns

# All dependencies are in go.mod
go mod download


What Makes This Special
========================
1. Real shell that persists directory changes
2. Natural language intentions
3. Built-in DNS router with logging
4. WiFi hotspot monitoring capability
5. Cross-platform support
6. Service installation helpers
7. IPTP philosophy throughout
8. Clean, small, focused chunks
9. Relaxed, step-by-step approach
10. NASA/Boeing RTOS thinking


Example Workflow
================
$ sudo ./iptp
[IPTP-1] ~$ name "monitoring home network"
✓ Shell named: monitoring_home_network

[monitoring_home_network] ~$ dns start
✓ DNS Router starting on 0.0.0.0:53
  Upstream: 8.8.8.8:53
  Log file: /tmp/iptp_dns_queries.log

# Enable WiFi hotspot, connect devices

[monitoring_home_network] ~$ dns logs 10
=== Last 10 DNS Queries ===
[14:23:45] 192.168.2.10 -> youtube.com. (A) = 142.250.185.110
[14:23:46] 192.168.2.11 -> facebook.com. (A) = 157.240.22.35
...

[monitoring_home_network] ~$ dns stats
=== DNS Router Statistics ===
Total queries: 1247
Unique domains: 342
Running: true

[monitoring_home_network] ~$ save
✓ Saved state for: monitoring_home_network

[monitoring_home_network] ~$ exit


Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
==============================
Phase 1 (Complete): Core Shell + DNS Router
Phase 2 (Next):     Domain filtering, real-time dashboard
Phase 3 (Future):   DNSSEC, custom records, analytics
Phase 4 (Vision):   Full IPTP ecosystem with multiple DNs
